# apollo-server-express-app
This Application is for my Senior Design Project in Univsersity.
It's uses the MERN Stack and will have a website and mobile application

I've written the Back End API's are written with GraphQL and the Apollo-Express-Client Version 4. 
All of the GraphQL queries and Mutations have been developed along with the GraphQL Schemas.

I set the application up to a MongoDB cloud database. Within the backend of the project, I'm using mongoose for Schema Validation and DB calls.

I've also created a small React front-end for testing some key important API's. 
With that i have JWT User Authentication both on the back and front end when a user logs in they have 2 hours to be on the website and App.
